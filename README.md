Understanding the Condition (State) of your Assets.

As the owner of plant and equipmnet you always have to understand the conditon of your assets to make informed decision on where and when to spend valuable OPEX or CAPEX to maintain the service level of your assets.

It is therefore important to always as and answer the follwoing questions: 

        What do we own?
        Where is it? 
        What does it do? 
        What is it supposed to do?
        What is its condition?
        What is its remnant life?
        What did it cost? What revenue does it earn?
        What does it cost to keep doing its OEM function?
        What alternative/ opportunity do we have?
        How do I know all of the above?-Visually Display it

This Project Provide some insights into some of these question through visualisation of the data 
A Landing page provide a holistic overview of the equipmnet status through colour coding and sizing of teh markers using a colour index, and providing teh ability to click and view the detail:

An Analysis page provide the information as a layer that details teh distribution of the condition data:

Subsequent analys can then be done by exproting the data:

Maintenance is a special craft and we provide a vido to coach and mentor on teh imprtance of lubrication:

To fully Understand where teh assets are and identify larger structures a webage allow syou to select layers with data

The Challenge - If you choose to accept it:

  Your task is to tell a story with data visualisations.
  Focus on providing users an interactive way to explore data themselves.
  Prepare a 10-minute presentation that lays out your theme, coding approach, data
  wrangling techniques, and final visualisation.

The Requirements:

  1. Your visualisation must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at
  least one database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
  
  2. Your project should fall into one of the below three tracks:
  
    ○ A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly

    ○ A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data 
      visualisation (must be approved)
  3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
  
  4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
  
  5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction, such as menus, dropdowns,
  and textboxes.
  
  6. If possible, your final visualisation should include at least three views.

The Timeline:
  Day 1 (Next Class)
  Start brainstorming topics with your group and researching potential datasets. Your focus be:
  
        ● Selecting a topic
        
        ● Finding a dataset
        
        ● Finding inspiration
        
        ● “Sketching” your ideal visuals
        
        ● Creating a 1-page proposal
        
  Day 2
  
  You will need to create a one-page proposal that includes:
  
      ● A brief articulation of your chosen topic and rationale
      
      ● A link to your dataset(s) and a screenshot of the metadata, if it exists.
      
      ● Three or four screenshots of relevant, “inspiring” visualisations that show your creative ideas
      
      ● A sketch of the final design
      
      ● A link to the primary GitHub repository where you’ll be housing your work
