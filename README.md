# Project-3-DataVisualization
Project-3Team-5-DataVisualization

The Challenge - If you choose to accept it:

  Your task is to tell a story with data visualisations.
  Focus on providing users an interactive way to explore data themselves.
  Prepare a 10-minute presentation that lays out your theme, coding approach, data
  wrangling techniques, and final visualisation.

The Requirements:

  1. Your visualisation must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at
  least one database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
  
  2. Your project should fall into one of the below three tracks:
  
    ○ A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly

    ○ A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data 
      visualisation (must be approved)
  3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
  
  4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
  
  5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction, such as menus, dropdowns,
  and textboxes.
  
  6. If possible, your final visualisation should include at least three views.

The Timeline:
  Day 1 (Next Class)
  Start brainstorming topics with your group and researching potential datasets. Your focus be:
  
        ● Selecting a topic
        
        ● Finding a dataset
        
        ● Finding inspiration
        
        ● “Sketching” your ideal visuals
        
        ● Creating a 1-page proposal
        
  Day 2
  
  You will need to create a one-page proposal that includes:
  
      ● A brief articulation of your chosen topic and rationale
      
      ● A link to your dataset(s) and a screenshot of the metadata, if it exists.
      
      ● Three or four screenshots of relevant, “inspiring” visualisations that show your creative ideas
      
      ● A sketch of the final design
      
      ● A link to the primary GitHub repository where you’ll be housing your work
